`puts` and `print` are both ways to log messages to the console but puts adds a newline character at the end.

`gets` is a way to accept input from a user in the terminal.

gets always returns a newline character at the end.  To trim the separator, `#chomp` is a string method that can be used. Such as `gets.chomp`

`putc` outputs one character at a time.

`pp` is like p but it prints big hashes and arrays in a nicer way.
